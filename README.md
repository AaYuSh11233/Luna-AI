## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How is LUNA different from Alexa or Google Assistant?
A: LUNA is designed specifically for desktop environments with deep system integration. Unlike cloud-only assistants, LUNA can perform offline tasks and directly control your computer.

A: LUNA maintains basic functionality offline, including system commands and application control. Only cloud-dependent features like AI chat and YouTube require internet.
