# ‚ùì **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How is LUNA different from Alexa or Google Assistant?**  
A: LUNA is designed specifically for desktop environments with deep system integration. Unlike cloud-only assistants, LUNA can perform offline tasks and directly control your computer.

**Q: What happens if the internet connection fails?**  
A: LUNA maintains basic functionality offline, including system commands and application control. Only cloud-dependent features like AI chat and YouTube require internet.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes. LUNA processes most commands locally and only sends data to the cloud when necessary (like for AI responses). No personal data is stored on external servers.

**Q: Will LUNA work on my Mac/Linux system?**  
A: Currently, LUNA is Windows-only, but cross-platform support is a key priority in our roadmap.

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: LUNA is currently free during the beta phase. Future pricing will include both free and premium tiers with advanced features.
